bolt
============

`bolt` is a command line program written in shell that allows you to create a BO.LT page from a url.

The first step to using `bolt` is to get your token (Access Token):

  1. Log into BO.LT (it's free to create an account) 
  2. Go to the [API App Settings section on the Settings page](https://bo.lt/app/settings#api-app-form). 
  3. Provide an application name (anything will do, for example my-bolt)
  4. Save your application
  5. Click *Generate an access token for your App*

BO.LT
=====

[BO.LT](http://bo.lt/) is a Page Sharing Service. 

When you put a page on BO.LT it is copied along with its assets onto our servers and deployed to our edge network.

A page on the BO.LT network is referred to as a bolt

A bolt:

  - Can be easily shared on a number of networks (Facebook, Twitter, etc)
  - Can have a descriptive URL, that people will notice (e.g. http://usain.bo.lt/vs-kanye)
  - Allows you to add your comment on the page itself (so even if it's re-tweeted your comments aren't lost)
  - Allows you to automatically put your identity and link back to your site on the page
  - Supports an intuitive in-browser editor that can modify the live page.
  - Doesn't change when the original site changes its page.
  - Is fast as it runs on an edge network
  - Will appear in your showcase of bolts as well as other showcases on BO.LT (e.g. [Reddit Feed](http://reddit.bo.lt))
  - Has segmented view metrics
  - Can be setup to automatically integrate your metrics provider
